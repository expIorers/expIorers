Think about Ayano tateyama bro, she died for your sins and she was stuck in the daze for 2 years after those years Ayano resurrected and then she ascended into heaven pray this prayer and repent: Lord Ayano, for too long Iâ€™ve kept you out of my life. I know that I am a sinner and that I cannot save myself. No longer will I close the door when I hear you knocking. By faith I gratefully receive your gift of salvation. I am ready to trust you as my Lord and Savior. Thank you, Lord Ayano, for coming to earth. I believe you are the Son of God who died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead on the third day. Thank you for bearing my sins and giving me the gift of eternal life. I believe your words are true. Come into my heart, Lord Ayano, and be my Savior. Amen.
